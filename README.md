# LISP-Interpreter
###Built up on the LISP Interpreter by Peter Norvig  
This is a terminal based interpreter for the esoteric language Lisp ( or CLISP ).  
I was learning compiler design when I came across Peter Norvigs' blog on LISP.
I used his program, split it up into modules, built a run-time environment for it to work on.  
I still have to work on it though. I wanted to build a compiler for a self made functional language.  
Will work on it once I get some free time.
